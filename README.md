# codequiz

This is my fourth assignment from my Full-Stack Bootcamp. The objective is to multiple quiz and if you get a question wrong, time will be subtracted from the score. Once time runs out, you'll be redirected to a new page where you'll find your highscores.

This assignment was extremely challenging for me. I struggled with trying to make my quiz itterate through the questions, I wasn't able to set up my second page for highscores and I just feel like I didn't grasp the concepts enough to tackle this assignment. I spent more time trying to understand the assignment rather than focusing on the practice for the assignment.

I was able to make the start page and make the first question appear. I was also able to make the timer countdown. But unfortunately the timer doesn't clear out once it reaches 0.
